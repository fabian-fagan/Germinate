Game description:

When the world is dry and barren and all that is left is exploding cactuses, you are 
the final wizard left with the magic seeds to bring back the trees of the earth.
Use your main attack, special attack and melee weapon to fight off hordes of skeletons
and jump over platforms and obstacles to reach all of the planting points and complete the levels. 
The game is a 2D Platformer with NPCs, enemy characters and exploding obstacles. The level is 
complete when the player has planted all 3 seeds in different planting points. 

Working with Unreal was a learning curve, however I came to find deep enjoyment in the blueprint
system once I grasped how it functioned through many tutorials and explanations. I found the most 
difficulty in creating the enemy AI characters, specifically creating an enemy which smoothly followed
and attacked the player and didn't simply run at the player with its sword swinging from 
half way across the map. I also had an ongoing problem with some of the textures when using PaperSprite 
as translucent sprites were causing errors, but I eventually found a fix by changing some rendering settings. 
Animations and flipbooks were also a struggle at first, specifically knowing when to change a sprites 
flipbook and how to make it look seamless and not choppy. I did this by adding delays inbetween animation
changes which seemed to work well. 

I think the game has an interesting premise, to revegetate the planet after some unknown chaos caused 
mass wipeout of all plants and left only toxic and exploding cactuses (and skeletons). I think the game
becomes more immersive and "feels like more of a game" through the use of the many sounds I added such as
attacking sound effects, skeleton sound effects which trigger when you have been spotted, planting sounds
when the character is planting which are activated through an interaction using the 'E' key and are completed
when a bar is full. Other sounds also include the explosion of cactuses and background music throughout.
The double-jump feature also allows for more complicated and challenging level design which I was aiming for
as in my opinion a platformer game should push the player to learn the mechanics of the game better in order
to progress. Thank you for reading and I hope you enjoy the idea and implementation of my game demo.
