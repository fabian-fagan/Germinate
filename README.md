## Germinate

When the world is dry and barren and all that is left is exploding cactuses, you are 
the final wizard left with the magic seeds to bring back the trees of the earth.
Use your main attack, special attack and melee weapon to fight off hordes of skeletons
and jump over platforms and obstacles to reach all of the planting points and complete the levels. 
The game is a 2D Platformer with NPCs, enemy characters and exploding obstacles. The level is 
complete when the player has planted all 3 seeds in different planting points.
